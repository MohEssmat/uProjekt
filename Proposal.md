# uProjekt Project Calendar (Project 1)

## Project Description

A programmer requires a responsive planner for scheduling timeframes to complete a project. The planner will be allocated based on the project's deadline, with "Typical", "Accelerated", and "Custom" options available.

The planner will use MomentJS or a similar library to incorporate date and time.

## User Story

```md
AS A programmer with upcoming projects,
I WANT an online program to manage them based on the timeframe it will take to complete each component (planning, coding, etc.),
SO THAT I can deliver my finished projects on-time.
```

## Proposed API's

1. Validator.pizza -- This application verifies email addresses for user contact and accounts: https://www.validator.pizza/

2. Non-working days -- This application incorporates non-working days (weekends, holidays, etc.) into scheduling: https://isdayoff.ru/ (NOTE: There is an English translation that we plan to use; otherwise we'll find a similar app)

## Project Calendar wireframe

The following is a screenshot of the wireframe, highlighting the website's proposed appearance and functionality:

It includes: a header and nav bar; a placeholder for a website logo/icon/background image; interactive cards for the designated project planner templates; and a footer with contact info.

## (Rough) breakdown of tasks:

Our plan is to work on the project collectively, starting with establishing the CSS framework and then building in the Javascript functionality.
